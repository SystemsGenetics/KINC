\section{Introduction}

KINC is designed for use in construction of biological networks, specifically, 
gene co-expression networks.

KINC is divided into three major classes; Console, Data, and Analytic. The 
\h{Console} 
class is responsible for controlling the program and presenting the user input 
and output interface with data or analytic objects. The abstract \h{Data} class 
is an interface that is used to implement a data object which is responsible 
for storing certain types of biological data. The abstract \h{Analytic} class is 
an interface that can be used to implement an analytic object which is 
responsible for taking data object inputs and creating new data object from 
them using statistical methods.

\newpage
\section{Main Program}

The main program consists of a console management class which acts as the 
program's controller and two abstract classes that create a common 
interface to the program. Any implementation data or analytic object must 
inherit and follow this interface.

\subsection{Console}

The \h{Console} class has a single instance within the main program and is 
designed to be given control through its \h{run()} 
function. This class creates a terminal console for the user, creates and 
manages all \h{Data} objects, and handles all \h{Analytic} execution.

This class also interfaces with the plugin object factory functions that 
generate new data or analytic interface object based off their unique names. 
These functions are implemented in a common source file which requires editing 
and recompiling whenever a new plugin is added to the program.

The KINC program upon execution presents the user with a console. 
\autoref{intro:ccommands} shows the basic commands this console will support.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=vtable]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
history & Shows the history of a given data file. \\
\hline
load & Loads a new data file with the given type and name. \\
\hline
export & Exports a given data file to an ASCII export file. \\
\hline
query & Query a given data file for information. \\
\hline
merge & Merge two or more data files into one, if possible. \\
\hline
list & List all loaded data files. \\
\hline
quit & Quit the program. \\
\hline
gpu & GPU commands. \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Basic Console Commands}
\label{intro:ccommands}
\end{figure}

The \h{history} command is handles by this class and prints the provanence of 
the given data file that is loaded.

The \h{load} command is partially handled by this class. This command has two 
or three arguments. The first argument is always the data object type to be 
loaded. The next argument is the binary file of the data object. The third 
optional argument is a human readable text file that will be used as data to 
import into the data object if it is newer than the binary file.

The \h{export} command is handled by a data object. The first argument is the 
name of the data object to export. The second argument is the file name that it 
will be exported to as human readable text. Any other arguments are optional 
and passed to the data object referenced.

The \h{query} command is handled by a data object. The first argument is the 
name of the data object to query. All other arguments are optional and passed 
along to the data object referenced.

The \h{merge} command is handled by the new data object that merges two or 
more data objects into a new data object. All arguments before the last 
argument are data objects to be merged into this new data object. 
The last argument is the name of the new data object that will contain the 
merged data. All input data types must also be of the same type. The new data 
object is responsible for implementing the merging of data or do nothing and 
return a fail if not appropriate.

The \h{list} command is handled by this class and prints out a list of all 
currently loaded data objects.

The \h{quit} command will exit the KINC program.

The \h{gpu} command has a list of subcommands for querying and setting up any 
GPGPU device to be used with analytic objects. \autoref{intro:gpucommands} shows 
the subcommands pertaining to GPGPU setup through OpenCL.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=vtable]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Command} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
list & List all availbale OpenCL compatible devices. \\
\hline
set & Set a specific OpenCL device to be used for accelerated computation. \\
\hline
clear & Clear any previously set OpenCL device. \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{GPU Console Subcommands}
\label{intro:gpucommands}
\end{figure}

The \h{gpu list} command will give a complete list of all available OpenCL 
devices along with their address. An address is two numbers seperated by a 
colon.

The \h{gpu set} command will set the program's analytics to use a specific 
OpenCL device given by its address.

The \h{gpu clear} command will clear any set OpenCL device the program would 
use with analytics.

Any other command will be treated as the name of an analytic object to load and 
execute. All arguments of an analytic command will be passed to the analytic. 
If no analytic is found with the given name nothing is done.

\autoref{fig:console:func} shows the public functions this class implements.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
Console();
void run(int,char*[]);
bool add(Data*,std::string&);
bool del(std::string&);
Data* find(std::string&);
Data* new_data(std::string&);
Analytic* new_analytic(std::string&);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for Console Class}
\label{fig:console:func}
\end{figure}

The \h{run(...)} function is called by \h{main()} and maintains control until 
an exit command. It provides a console for the user or executes a script, 
depending on the command line arguments supplied. Once the user exits the 
console or the script has finished executing this function returns back to 
\h{main()} for final program closure.

The \h{add(...)} function adds a new \h{Data} object to the list of 
available \h{Data} objects within the console with the name string supplied. 
The name must be unique from all other loaded \h{Data} objects.

The \h{del(...)} function removes the \h{Data} object from t he list with the 
name string specified if it exists. If it exists and it was removed it returns 
\h{TRUE} else it returns \h{FALSE}.

The \h{find(...)} function finds a loaded \h{Data} object with the given name. 
If no object is found with that name then \h{NULL} is returned, else a 
pointer to the found object is returned.

The \h{new\_data(...)} function creates a new data object of the type 
specified in the supplied string. If the string is not a valid data type then 
\h{NULL} is returned, else a pointer to the new data object is returned.

The \h{new\_analytic(...)} creates a new analytic object of the type specified 
in the supplied string. If the string is not a valid analytic type then 
\h{NULL} is returned, else a pointer to the new analytic object is returned.

The \h{new\_data(...)} and \h{new\_analytic(...)} functions are designed to be 
plugin object factories which return data and analytic objects with the type 
given to them as a string. These two functions along with the list of all 
available plugins containing their unique string names and unique number 
identifiers are all contained in the same source and header file. These two 
files will represent where new static plugins that implement either a data or 
analytic interface can be added.

\subsubsection{ConsoleStream}

The \h{ConsoleStream} class is a common output interface to be used by all data 
and analytic objects for providing output to the user. This class is 
responsible for receiving output from objects and directing it to the user 
interface.

\autoref{mainp:console:consolestream} shows the public functions this class 
implements. The constructor takes a single argument which tells an instance of 
its output is general, warning, or error output. An enumerated list will be 
defined in the class for each possible output.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
ConsoleStream(int);
void print(short);
void print(unsigned short);
void print(int);

void flush();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for ConsoleStream Class}
\label{mainp:console:consolestream}
\end{figure}

The \h{print} functions takes the given output variable and prints it to its 
objects output type. The overloaded stream operators do the same thing.

The \h{flush} function will flush any output given to the stream and write it 
to the user interface.

This class will not be instantiated by any data object. There will be three 
objects of this class as public variables of the \h{Console} class. 
\autoref{mainp:console:objects} shows the three public objects of this class 
the \h{Console} class will possess and what they are.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Object} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline

\hline
err & Output used for error messages. \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{ConsoleStream Objects for Console Class}
\label{mainp:console:objects}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data}

The abstract \h{Data} class creates a common data object interface to the 
console program and provides binary file input/output for any data class 
implementing it. This class is responsible for implementing the basic file input 
and output operations, reading the header of binary files and its history 
information, and specifying a common interface with the console program.

Additional functions should be added to any implementations of this interface 
class manipulating the specific type of data.

\autoref{fig:data:func} shows the public functions this class defines. Most of 
these functions are pure virtual functions that any class inheriting this class 
are required to implement. The constructor takes a single argument which is the 
binary file location where the data for an object is stored.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
Data();
void __history();
virtual uint32_t type() = 0;
virtual bool __load(std::string&) = 0;
virtual bool __load(std::string&,std::string&) = 0;
virtual bool __export(std::string&,std::vector<std::string>&) = 0;
virtual void __query(std::vector<std::string>&) = 0;
virtual bool __merge(std::vector<std::string>&) = 0;
virtual bool flush() = 0;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for Data Class}
\label{fig:data:func}
\end{figure}

The \h{\_\_history()} function prints the entire history of its object to 
the console stream.

The virtual \h{type()} function must return the unique identier of the type of 
data this object represents. The list of unique identifiers are stored in a 
common header file.

The virtual \h{\_\_load(...)} function is called when a load console command 
is issued on a new data object. The first argument is the file name of the 
binary file to load. The optional second argument is the location of a human 
readable file to import if it is newer than the binary file. The data object 
will overwrite any current data in the binary file if it imports new data from 
the human readable file provided by the second optinoal argument. This 
function is responsible for loading data from a human readable ASCII file and 
encoding it into its binary format in a new file of the same name. This 
function returns \h{TRUE} if the command was successful else it returns 
\h{FALSE}.

The virtual \h{\_\_export(...)} function is called when a export console command 
is issued on a given data object. The first argument is the location of the 
output file where the human readable format will be written to. The second 
argument is the list of remaining optional arguments. This function is 
responsible for exporting its internal data stored in binary format and decoding 
it into a human readable file. This function returns \h{TRUE} if the command was 
successful else it returns \h{FALSE}.

The virtual \h{\_\_query(...)} function is called when a query console command 
is issued on a given data object. The single argument is the list of optional 
arguments. This function is responsible for retreiving information from 
data this object holds using command line arguments given.

The virtual \h{\_\_merge(...)} function is called when a merge console command 
is issued on a given data object. The single argument is the list of data 
object names that will be merged into this new data object. This function is 
responsible for merging two or more seperate data objects of the same type into 
a new single data object. The data object this command is called on is the new 
data object that will merge all data from all input data objects. This function 
is not required to merge the given data objects if not appropriate. This 
function returns \h{TRUE} if the command was successful else it returns 
\h{FALSE} if nothing was merged for any reason.

The \h{\_\_load(...)}, \h{\_\_export(...)}, \h{\_\_merge(...)}, and \h{flush()} 
functions will not return control to the caller of the function until all write 
operations to the binary file the data object represents have completed.

\autoref{fig:data:func:prot} shows the protected functions this class 
implements that a class inheriting this abstract class can use for file input 
and output of its binary data. These functions are designed to hide the raw 
file from an implemenation class so it is impossible to overwrite the header 
section of the file.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
bool fopen(const std::string&);
uint64_t fsize();
bool fgrow(uint64_t);
void fseek(uint64_t);
template<class T> bool fread(T*,uint64_t);
template<class T> bool fwrite(T*,uint64_t);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Protected Functions for Data Class}
\label{fig:data:func:prot}
\end{figure}

The \h{fopen(...)} function opens the binary file given to this data object. It 
returns \h{TRUE} if the file was successfully opened or \h{FALSE} if it failed.

The \h{fsize()} function returns the total size of the binary file in bytes. 
This does not include the header information that is hidden from any 
implementation class.

The \h{fgrow()} function will increase the size of the binary file by the 
number of bytes given. If this was successful it returns \h{TRUE} else if it 
could not grow the size of the file it returns \h{FALSE}.

The \h{fseek()} function will move the file position's indent to the number 
given in bytes. This number must be within range of the total size of the 
binary file.

The \h{fread(...)} function reads the number of elements given and writes them 
to the pointer of that element type given, starting at the current file 
position and incrementing by the number of bytes read. The new file position 
cannot exceed the total size of the file.

The \h{fwrite(...)} function overwrites the number of elements given from the 
given pointer to the binary file, starting at the current file position and 
incrementing by the number of bytes overwritten. The new file position cannot 
exceed the total size of the file.

This abstract class is responsible for reading in the header information of any 
data file since it is generic to all data files. This section of the binary file 
is hidden from any implementation class.

\autoref{fig:kincdata:header} shows the binary format for the beginning 
of a data file.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=btable]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|l|X|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Type} \\
\hline
header & KINC & Special header tag specifying this is a KINC binary data file.

\hline
historySize & & Total size of all history items in bytes. & uint32\_t \\
\hline

\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Binary File Format of Header}
\label{fig:kincdata:header}
\end{figure}

The \h{header} field is a special tag that specifies this is a KINC data file. 
The \h{type} field represents the specific type of data this file represents. 
The \h{historySize} field represents the total size of all history data in 
bytes.

\autoref{fig:kincdata:history} shows the format for a single history item 
within the history buffer. History items are nested inside one another, the 
highest history element being the history of the current file, and all 
subhistories being the history for all input files.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=btable]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Type} \\

\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Binary File Format of Individual History Item}
\label{fig:kincdata:history}
\end{figure}

The \h{elemSize} field represents the total size of this history item, 
including all subhistory items nested within it.

The \h{file}, \h{object}, and \h{command} fields represent the name of the 
files, the object that created the data, and the specific KINC console command 
that invoked the creation of the file, respectively. The \h{fileLen}, 
\h{objectLen}, and \h{commandLen} give the length of the respective character 
strings.

The \h{date} field represents the date when this data file was last modified.

The \h{subHistoryAmt} field gives the total number of subhistory items for 
this history item. This does not include any input history nested within those 
history items. The \h{subHistorySize} represents the total size of all nested 
history items in bytes, respectively. The \h{subHistory} field contains the 
list of all nested subhistory items contained within this history item.

\subsection{Analytic}

The abstract \h{Analytic} class creates a common analytic interface to the 
console program. This class is almost a pure virtual class and accepts a 
pointer to an OpenCL context in its constructor, that is provided from the 
console.

\autoref{fig:kincanalytic} shows the constructor and virtual functions that an 
implemenation of this class must define. The constructor takes a pointer to an 
OpenCL context that can be used for accelerated computation of the data, but it 
is not required and can be given \h{NULL}. An implementation of this class is 
required to provide a means to compute its data with or without an OpenCL 
device.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
Analytic(cl::Context*);
virtual uint32_t type() = 0;
virtual bool execute(std::vector<std::string>&) = 0;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for Analytic Class}
\label{fig:kincanalytic}
\end{figure}

The virtual \h{type()} function must return the unique identier of the type of 
analytic this object represents. The list of unique identifiers are stored in a 
common header file.

The virtual \h{execute(...)} function is called for this analytic to perform 
the computation it is designed to implement. The list of arguments given are 
provided by the user on the console. This command must be blocking until all 
file input/output has completed.

Typically this class takes input from one or more data files and creates a new 
data file as a result. This class is responsible for interacting with these 
data objects and creating a new data object if one is needed. This class must 
know all pertinent functions for all data types that it reads and writes.

\subsection{Exceptions}

Exception classes are defined for data and analytic objects. Any class 
implementing a data or analytic type must use their respective exception 
classes when throwing any exception. If a data or analytic object throws an 
exception the console will catch it. If the exception caught is from a data 
object the console will remove if from the list of loaded data objects. In 
either case the console will report an error to the user about the object 
throwing an exception.

\autoref{mainp:except:funcs} shows the public functions the base exception 
class implements. The constructor is given 3 arguments. These arguments are the 
name of the file where the exception occured, the line number where it occured, 
and a textual description of the type of exception, respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
Exception(const char*,int,const char*);
const char* file();
int line();
const char* what();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for Exception Class}
\label{mainp:except:funcs}
\end{figure}

The \h{file()} function returns the name of the file where the exception was 
thrown. The \h{line()} function returns the line in the source code where the 
exception was thrown. The \h{what()} function returns the specific type of 
exception that was thrown.

\subsubsection{DataException}

\textbf{Inherits from \h{Exception} Class.}

The \h{DataException} class must be used for all data classes when reporting 
errors.

\autoref{mainp:dataexcept:funcs} shows the public functions this class 
implements. The constructor is given 4 arguments. These arguments are the name 
of the file where the exception occured, the line number where it occured, a 
pointer to the data object that threw it, and a textual description of the type 
of exception, respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
DataException(const char*,int,Data*,const char*);
Data* who();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for DataException Class}
\label{mainp:dataexcept:funcs}
\end{figure}

The \h{who()} function returns a pointer to the data object and threw an 
exception.

\subsubsection{AnalyticException}

\textbf{Inherits from \h{Exception} Class.}

The \h{AnalyticException} class must be used for all data classes when 
reporting errors.

\autoref{mainp:analyticexcept:funcs} shows the public functions this class 
implements. The constructor is given 4 arguments. These arguments are the name 
of the file where the exception occured, the line number where it occured, a 
pointer to the analytic object that threw it, and a textual description of the 
type of exception, respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{mdframed}[style=functions]

Analytic* who();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{Functions for AnalyticException Class}
\label{mainp:analyticexcept:funcs}

The \h{who()} function returns a pointer to the analytic object and threw an 
exception.

\section{Data Classes}

\subsection{Expression}

The Expression class is responsible for manging gene expression-level data.  

\subsubsection{Properties}

\stephen{Do we need any properties?}

\josh{I don't think we need properties. I am also unsure how to implement them 
in C++. My thought is all interactions between the classes will be defined in 
the Abstract Classes section using virtual functions?}

\subsubsection{Constructor}

{\bfseries Data(int argc, char *argv[])}

\stephen{We need to design how the functions of the class will receive 
arguments.  will we have a constructor that receives, parses and responds to 
errors for all functions?  Or should each function be responsible for checking 
it's own arguments. I know we can't do that in the abstract class, but 
we need to accomdate the behavior we settle on in our design so plugins
are consistent.}

\josh{I almost completely agree. These functions and interactions will all be 
defined in the abstract classes section if that is OK? It is standard C++ to 
define everything you are talking about in the abstract interface class with 
virtual functions. It is usually a good idea to have a default constructor only 
for implemenation classes, and have any additional configuation added into 
additional virtual functions that any implementation must handle.}

\subsubsection{Virtual Functions}

The following functions should be implemented by any plugin that creates
classes that inherits the Data class.

{\bfseries virtual void import() = 0}

This function reads a tab-delimited file.  Each line of this file
represents the gene expression levels of a single gene, transcript or probeset.
Each tab-separated value in a single line indicates the gene expression level 
for each sample. The expression level of a samples must be in the same 
order for every line.  The first line of the file may contain a tab-delimited
list of sample names, and a file may contain as many samples and genes as
desired.

\subsubsection{File Structure}

\autoref{fig:expression} shows the binary format of expression data and how it 
is stored on file. \h{geneAmt} and \h{sampleAmt} give the total number of genes 
and samples in the data, respectively. \h{geneNames} is the list of all gene 
names as a string who's length and partitioning is defined by \h{geneNameLen} 
and \h{geneNameSize}. \h{sampleNames} is the list of all sample names as a 
string who's length and partitioning is defined by \h{sampleNameLen} and 
\h{sampleNameSize}. Lastly, \h{samples} is 2 dimensional matrix of all samples 
for each gene, where the matrix is sorted by gene major order.

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Correlation}

This is responsible for storing correlation data between genes.

The following describes the format of the KINC correlation file. All 
multi-byte numbers are little-endian, regardless of the machine endianness.

\stephen{I like this type of table for describing the file format. I borrowed 
it from the BAM file specification}

\josh{So do I! I was actually going to convert these defintions to a tabular 
format after your first review. :)}

\autoref{fig:correlation} shows the binary format of correlation data and how 
it is stored on file. \h{geneAmt}, \h{sampleAmt}, and \h{corrAmt} give the 
number of genes, number of samples per gene, and number of correlations per 
gene, respectively. \h{geneNames} is the list of all gene names that are 
correlated who's length and partitioning is defined by \h{geneNameLen} and 
\h{geneNameSize}. \h{sampleNames} is the list of all sample names used for 
correlation between genes who's length and partitioning is defiend by 
\h{sampleNameLen} and \h{sampleNameSize}. \h{corrTypes} is the list of all 
correlation types listed for all gene pairs who's length and partitioning is 
defined by \h{corrTypeLen} and \h{corrTypeSize}. Lastly, \h{correlations} is a 
special diagonal matrix where all correlations for gene pairs are stored using 
gene major order.

\subsection{Network}

This is responsible for storing network data between genes.

\autoref{fig:network} shows the binary format of network data and how it is 
stored on file. \h{geneAmt} give the number of genes in the network. 
\h{geneNames} is the list of all gene names that are correlated who's length 
and 
partitioning is defined by \h{geneNameLen} and \h{geneNameSize}. Lastly, 
\h{network} is a special diagonal matrix where all network edges for gene pairs 
are stored using gene major order.

\subsection{Annotation}

This is responsible for storing additional information for genes.

\autoref{fig:annotation} shows the binary format of annotation data and how it 
is stored on file. \h{geneAmt} and \h{annotAmt} give the number of genes and 
the number of annotations, respectively. \h{geneNames} is the list of all gene 
names who's length and partitioning is defined by \h{geneNameLen} and 
\h{geneNameSize}.\h{annotNames} is the list of all annotation names who's 
length and partitioning is defined by \h{annotNameLen} and \h{annotNameSize}.
\h{annotValSize} is a list of all string lengths for each annotation value per 
each gene. Lastly, \h{annotations} is a 2 dimensional matrix that lists all 
annotations for all genes using gene major order.
